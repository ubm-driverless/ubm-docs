# HOW TO
## Instructions to set up the "ubm-f1tenth" enviroment on Linux/Mac
If you're on MacOS you'd have to install tigervnc-viewer through the website, otherwise on Linux you can do:
```bash
sudo apt install tigervnc-viewer

```
To remove the corrupted configs and restore the docker CLI config to default
Run the following command:
```bash
sudo rm ~/.docker/config.json
```
Now clone the repository and enter its folder.
Now we're gonna build our docker environment running the following command:
```bash
docker build -t f1tenth-ubm-sim -f Dockerfile .
```
This will take a long time, around 10-30 minutes. You only have to do it once! Now start the docker container.
```bash
docker compose up
```
And in as many other terminals as you want to access the simulation run: 
```bash
docker exec -it ubm-f1tenth-sim-1 /bin/bash
```
In one of these terminals bring up the simulation:
```bash
launch sim.py
```
Now that the simulation is up, you can see it by launching TigerVNC Viewer it will be in your windows apps.
Connect to the server:
- **VNC Server:** `localhost:5901`
- **Password:** `[redacted]`  

You will see the car and the track!  
In another one of the Visual Studio Code terminals start up the control stack:
```bash
launch control.py
```
In another one of these terminals send virtual telecommand signals:
```bash
press_circle
```
This starts the pure pursuit algorithm and the car will move. The telecommand to stop the car is:
```bash
press_L1
```
To shut it down, go to the first terminal, the one you started the container with "docker compose up" and press ^C.
Next time you wish to code, open VSCode in the correct directory, start docker and connect with Tiger VNC.


## Instructions to set up the "ubm-f1tenth" enviroment on Windows
For compatibility, it runs within WSL. This is a linux virtual machine provided by Microsoft that runs with near bare metal performance.
Open a powershell prompt and install WSL:
```bash
wsl --install
```
To make sure wsl uses Ubuntu as the default distribution:
```bash
wsl -s Ubuntu
```
Now open wsl by typing:
```bash
wsl
```
By default, you are put in a mount on your C: drive. For read/write performance, we will create a folder in your linux home.
```bash
cd ~
mkdir  F1Tenth
cd F1Tenth
```
Now we set up github to clone the repository in this directory using SSH keys, since passwords are deprecated.
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Press enter to accept the default file location.
Set a password.  
Copy your SSH key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
Go to https://github.com/settings/ssh/new and name your key, then paste it and click "Add SSH key".
Now you can clone the repo:
```bash
git@github.com:ubm-driverless/ubm-f1tenth.git
```
Install a virtual desktop agent:
```bash
sudo apt install tigervnc-viewer
```
Do not close the powershell but go back to your Windows desktop, we have Docker Desktop and Visual Studio Code to install:
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/   
https://code.visualstudio.com/download  
Open Docker Desktop, go to general settings and ensure that "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is checked. Go back to your powershell.
Navigate inside the repo and open it in Visual Studio code.
```bash
cd ubm-f1tenth/
code .
```
This is your development enviroment. Cool! Now to install ROS2 in a docker container, use a new terminal within Visual Studio Code. This ensures it is the correct directory and also in WSL. It's perfectly fine to run this in a new terminal if the vs code one is not working. It might be solved by rebooting.
```bash
docker build -t f1tenth-ubm-sim -f Dockerfile .
```
This will take a long time, around ten minutes. You only have to do it once! Now start the docker container.
```bash
docker compose up
```
And in as many other terminals as you want to access the simulation: 
```bash
docker exec -it ubm-f1tenth-sim-1 /bin/bash
```
In one of these terminals bring up the simulation:
```bash
launch sim.py
```
Now that the simulation is up, you can see it by launching TigerVNC Viewer it will be in your windows apps.
Connect to the server:
- **VNC Server:** `localhost:5901`
- **Password:** `[redacted]`

Next time you wish to code, start WSL, open VSCode in the correct directory, start docker and connect with Tiger VNC.
# Useful Information

### When to Use `colcon build`
- **After Cloning a New ROS2 Package or Project:** If youâ€™ve cloned a new ROS2 package or project into your workspace, run `colcon build` to compile it.
- **After Modifying Code or Configuration Files:** If you make changes to source code or configuration files, you need to recompile using `colcon build`.
- **After Modifying CMakeLists.txt or package.xml:** Any changes to these files require recompilation.
- **When Adding New Dependencies:** If you add new dependencies, use `colcon build` to update them.
- **To Perform a Clean Build:** Use `colcon build --cmake-clean-cache` to remove the CMake cache and rebuild from scratch.

### Command:

colcon build

### Useful Options:
- **`--packages-select <package_name>`**: to compile only a specific package.

## Additional Notes

- **Rebuild Docker Environment:** Rebuild the environment only if modifications are made to the `Dockerfile`.
  
- **Change Map:** To change the map used in the simulation, modify the `sim.yaml` file located in the `f1_tenth_gym_ros` directory.

- **Control and Speed Profiles:** 
  - Modify `control.py` only in the `TUM_node`.
  - Create a speed profile (only if it doesn't exist already).
  - Adjust lines 21 and 22 in `raceline.py` if needed.


When changing a map change: control.py, raceline.py, f1_tenth_gym_ros/config/sim_yaml, launch_config.yaml
