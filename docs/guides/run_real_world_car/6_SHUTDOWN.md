# Shutdown

To shutdown properly the car:

1. Stop each algorithm running using `CTRL-C` to each ssh session
2. Close/Save all open files
3. push relevant changes to github (a.e. a new map)
4. Execute `sudo poweroff` and wait some time. At least until the fan stops spinning.
5. Turn the main power switch of the car to `OFF`
6. Unplug the battery

For the router is sufficient to press the power button and to unplug it.
